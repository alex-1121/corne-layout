# Layout for Corne

My customized keyboard layout for [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) keyboard.

This layout's beauty is in separate layers for:
 - Symbols
 - Numpad
 - Navigation
 - Media controls
   
These layers are accessed by holding down corresponding thumb keys. Check out comments in [keymap.c](https://github.com/alex-1121/corne-layout/blob/master/keymap.c) for layout's visual representation.

soundmonster's layout for Corne was used as a base, because of RGB implementation and better OLED support.
